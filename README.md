# PyQtGraph_Example
This repository demonstrate the use of pyqtgraph to create a real-time updating plot. The script initializes a graphical window and continuously updates a plot with new data points calculated as the sine of the current index.
The plot displays a sine wave with the x-axis representing the data points and the y-axis representing the sine values. The plot updates every 30 milliseconds to simulate a real-time data stream.
